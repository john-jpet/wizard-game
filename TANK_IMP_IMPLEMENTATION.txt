TANK IMP ENEMY IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## Tank Imp (Type 6) - Heavy Artillery Enemy

### Stats:
- HP: 7 (highest in game!)
- Speed: 0.33 px/frame (1 pixel every 3 frames - very slow and heavy)
- Size: 16x32 pixels (TALL - twice the height of normal enemies)
- Sprite: tank_imp metasprite (8 tiles in 2x4 grid)
- Palette: 1 (red/yellow)
- Fires: Regular enemy bullets at frame 30 (every 0.5 seconds)

### Behavior:
- Moves very slowly down screen (slower than slow imp)
- Fires bullets from bottom half (y + 16 offset due to height)
- High HP makes it a tank that soaks damage
- Large hitbox (16x32) makes it easier to hit but harder to dodge

### Spawn Timeline (360 frame cycle):

Frame 120: Fast Imp (type 1)
Frame 180: Fire Spirit (type 3) 
Frame 240: Slow Imp (type 0)
Frame 300: Large Slime (type 4)
Frame 330: Tank Imp (type 6) ← NEW! Heavy enemy
Frame 360: Warlock (type 2) → reset

## Complete Enemy Roster:

Type 0: Slow Imp (3 HP, 0.5 px/frame, fires bullets)
Type 1: Fast Imp (1 HP, 1 px/frame)
Type 2: Warlock (5 HP, 0.25 px/frame, 3-bullet spread, purple, stops to fire)
Type 3: Fire Spirit (2 HP, 0.5 down + 1 weaving, animated flames)
Type 4: Large Slime (3 HP, 0.5 px/frame, splits into 2 small slimes)
Type 5: Small Slime (1 HP, 1 px/frame, from splits only)
Type 6: Tank Imp (7 HP, 0.33 px/frame, 16x32 tall, fires bullets)

## Files Modified:
- gfx.h: Added tank_imp extern
- enemies.c: Added type 6 HP (7), hitbox (16x32), movement (slow), firing, drawing
- main.c: Added tank spawn at frame 330

## Design Notes:
- Tank imp is a "mini-boss" style enemy with highest HP
- Slow speed + large hitbox = easy to hit but hard to avoid
- Spawns late in cycle (frame 330) for climactic encounters
- 16x32 size is unique - only enemy that uses vertical space
- Fires standard bullets (not large bullets yet - could be upgraded later)

## Testing:
- Should appear as tall red enemy at 5.5 seconds into each cycle
- Takes 7 hits to kill (more than warlock's 5!)
- Moves noticeably slower than other enemies
- Fires bullets from bottom of sprite
